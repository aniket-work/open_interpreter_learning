**Install Open Interpreter**
----------------------------

**Why do this?**

*   **Isolation:** Creating a virtual environment keeps Open Interpreter's project files and its specific versions of libraries separate from other Python projects. This prevents conflicts and makes managing things much easier.
   
*   **PyCharm Integration:** Connecting this virtual environment to PyCharm allows you to work seamlessly with Open Interpreter's tools and code while enjoying your favorite IDE's features.
   

**Let's get started:**

1.  **Open Your Terminal:**
   

*   In PyCharm, click on the "Terminal" tab (it's usually found at the bottom of the window).
   

**2\. Create a Virtual Environment:**
```bash
python -m venv open_interpreter_env
```
This creates a folder named “open_interpreter_env” to house your virtual environment.


**3\. Activate the Environment:**

Windows:
```bash
open_interpreter_env\Scripts\activate
```
macOS/Linux
```bash
source open_interpreter_env/bin/activate
```

**4\.Install Open Interpreter:**

Make sure you’re still in your PyCharm project directory (~\PycharmProjects\open_interpreter_learning)
Now type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
pip install open-interpreter
```
This will download and install the Open Interpreter package into your virtual environment.

Install Ollama
Running Ollama with Open Interpreter is a straightforward process.

Step 1: Download Ollama
Where to download: Visit the official download page to get the Ollama application for your operating system. You can find it here
Step 2: Install Ollama
Installation: Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install Ollama on your device. During this process, you will need to enter your password to authorize the installation.
Step 3: Download a Model
View available models: Before you can start using Ollama with Open Interpreter, you’ll need a model. You can view all the available models here
Download the model: Open your command line interface (CLI) and type the following command to download your chosen model:

```bash
ollama run <model-name>
```

Replace <model-name> with the actual name of the model you want to download. This process may take some time depending on your internet connection and the model size.

**Step 5\: Set Up Open Interpreter**
Interactive setup: To set up Open Interpreter interactively, run the following command in your CLI:

```bash
interpreter --local
```

or use in code as below

```python
from interpreter import interpreter

interpreter.offline = True # Disables online features like Open Procedures
interpreter.llm.model = "ollama_chat/<model-name>"
interpreter.llm.api_base = "http://localhost:11434"

interpreter.chat()
```
